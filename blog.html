    CLOCA advises caution due to unsettled weather and warmer temperatures from Jan. 24 to Jan. 27. With anticipated rain and a
    snow-water equivalent of 27 mm, there's a risk of increased runoff and elevated water levels in streams. While widespread
    flooding isn't expected, CLOCA warns of potential hazards such as fast-flowing water, flooding in low-lying areas, and the
    breakup of ice cover. The public is urged to stay away from watercourses, shorelines, and certain structures until Jan. 28
    or until further notice, as conditions may be dangerous. </br></br>

                        The Central Lake Ontario Conservation Authority (CLOCA) has issued a warning urging caution in various
                        areas due to unsettled weather conditions and anticipated warmer temperatures. Between January 24 and 27,
                        temperatures are expected to rise above freezing with estimated precipitation of 25 to 45 mm, primarily
                        in the form of rain. This, coupled with recent snow survey data indicating an average snow-water equivalent
                        of 27 mm, is likely to lead to increased runoff, resulting in elevated water levels and flows in streams,
                        according to CLOCA.
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        While widespread flooding is not expected, the conservation authority cautions that fast-flowing water
                        and flooding might occur in flood-prone areas. The combination of milder temperatures and rain may
                        also lead to the weakening and breakup of existing ice cover, causing localized water-level increases,
                        ice jams, and flooding.
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        As a precautionary measure, CLOCA is advising the public to avoid watercourses, shorelines, and certain
                        structures like bridges, culverts, and dams. The dangerous conditions along stream banks and Lake Ontario
                        shorelines, including increased wave activity and slippery surfaces, make these locations extremely hazardous.

                    <p>
                        CLOCA has declared that its water safety statement will remain in effect through January 28 or until
                        further notice. Authorities are actively monitoring the situation, and residents are encouraged to stay
                        informed about updates and exercise caution in the mentioned areas.

                    Durham Regional Police are actively investigating an incident where a gunshot was fired at a Pickering

                    apartment was targeted, as the gunshot went through a patio door; however, the incident does not seem
                    to be a deliberate act. Fortunately, no injuries were reported.
